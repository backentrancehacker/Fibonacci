# Fibonacci
Finding the fibonacci sequence without recursion or loops.

## About
There are three modes: f1, f2, and f3. The default is F3, as it is the most accurate. You can set modes with .mode <mode> after staring the script.
* F1 is an approximation of Binet's Formula.
* F2 is basically Binet's formula again.
* F3 utilizes JS repeat to generate a function. This is more original than other examples, which used python string repeat.
